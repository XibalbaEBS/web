                <h2><span class="color-acento">Magic: The Gathering</span></h2>
                <p>A standard game of Magic involves two or more players who are engaged in a battle acting as powerful wizards, known as Planeswalkers. Each player has their own deck of cards, either one previously constructed or made from a limited pool of cards for the event. A player typically starts the game with a "life total" of twenty and loses the game when their life total is reduced to zero.
                    A player can also lose if they must draw from an empty deck. Some cards specify other ways to win or lose the game.
                    Additionally, one of the "Magic Golden Rules" is that "Whenever a card's text directly contradicts these rules, the card takes precedence".
