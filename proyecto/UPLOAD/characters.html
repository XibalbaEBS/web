		<h1>Gideon Jura</h1>
	</section>
	<section>
		<div class="pwinf" style="color: white;">
			<p>Gideon Jura, born Kytheon Iora, was a hieromancer and planeswalker beholden to the multiplanar coalition known as the Gatewatch. Affectionately called Gids by Chandra Nalaar and called Beefslab by Liliana Vess.</p>
			<p>Gideon was a large, muscular man with black hair, light brown skin, and a baritone voice. Fiercely loyal, unyielding, just and charismatic, Gideon Jura wouldn't hesitate to enter combat to defend the innocent. He was a powerful warrior-mage with the ability to make himself invulnerable. His distinctive weapon, the sural, consisted of four whip-like blades anchored to the exterior of his armguard. A man of the people, he took pride in leading his comrades towards the common good.</p>
			<p>Gideon believed that those with power should protect the weak, and took this belief personally, using his invulnerability to protect any in need. He was one to never lose faith in those he called friends, even when all others had, a belief he took to his death, giving his invulnerability to Liliana (although everyone else wished her dead), saving her from her fate at the cost of his own life.</p>
			<p>Gideon Jura was centered in white mana. As he planeswalked, he disappeared in a burst of light, a golden storm.</p>

		<h1>Jace Beleren</h1>
	</section>
	<section>
		<div class="pwinf" style="color: white;">
			<p>Jace is incredibly intelligent and capable of such talents as clairvoyance and illusion. His specialty, though, is in the art of mental magic which makes him unique within the multiverse. He has a reserved nature and a troubled conscience for the poor decisions he has made in the past. Curious, and always in control, Jace is a master of mind-reading, and memory modification, and is a master illusionist. His telepathic powers allow him to manipulate enemy mages by countering their magic or using their spells against them. He is mostly self-taught, as he has a habit of losing or deleting his memories. An adept analyst, he has an optimized plan, and a backup plan, for every situation.</p>

			<p>Jace is a slender young man with unkempt chestnut brown hair. He is 5'10" tall and weighs 160lbs. His white facial tattoos were created by the Ravnican Gruul, who took him in as a child. On his cloak, he sports a symbol derived from it: an elongated ring, open at the bottom, with a circle floating in the middle. The symbol represents a sphinx's collar, which for a long time was the one remaining memory of his home plane. He apparently used illusions for a time to make himself look more fit, but stopped doing so after he got in shape on Ixalan. He has a scar on his right ring finger, and another that begins on his knuckle and runs stick-straight up his arm. He has a small brown freckle in his eye.</p>

			<p>Jace is centered in blue mana. When creating spells, Jace's eyes shine bright blue with magic. He usually tries to avoid physical combat. As he planeswalks, he disappears in a complex crisscross pattern of blue light.</p>

		<h1>Liliana Vess</h1>
	</section>
	<section>
		<div class="pwinf" style="color: white;">
			<p>Raven-haired Liliana uses black mana to reanimate the dead, corrupt the living, and unlock power from death.</p>
			<p>She is charismatic, witty, and attractive, but profoundly cynical, cunning and egocentric. She cares little for others, seeing them as stepping stones on her path to greater power. It was this craving for power that brought her to the Chain Veil, an item she views with contempt at times, for its power comes at a terrible price. Though she appears to be in her late 20s or early 30s, she is actually over two centuries old. She has black hair and violet eyes and stands either 5'9" or 5'10" tall, weighing in at 140lbs. She prefers to wear luxurious, revealing dresses and a golden headpiece that she stole from an archangel. She hates angels. When Liliana planeswalks, she disappears in a cloud of black, inky vapor.</p>
			<p>After the Mending, she made a pact with four demons—Kothophed, Griselbrand, Razaketh, and Belzenlok—to secure her youth and power. For most of her time with the Gatewatch she sought a means to acquire her past freedom. Initially, she joined the Gatewatch as a means of defeating the demons of her past, freeing her of her contract, but grew to care for her allies (even if she wouldn't admit it). Ultimately her desire to protect those she loved outweighed her narcissistic tendencies, causing her to break her contract with Bolas that would end her life in a final show of defiance. When Gideon Jura sacrificed himself to save her, she felt an enormous weight of guilt which compelled a new stance on the importance of the people around her and the dangers of unbound hubris.</p>
			<p>To complete the demonic pact, Kothophed etched the contract in lines along Liliana's newly restored youthful skin. As she cast powerful spells, the lines sometimes glowed purple; when she drew on the power of the Chain Veil, they could bleed. The scars of her contract are still visible as of her time on Arcavios.</p>

		<h1>Chandra Nalaar</h1>
	</section>
	<section>
		<div class="pwinf" style="color: white;">
			<p>Chandra has bright auburn hair and amber eyes. She stands at 5'6" tall and weighs 130lbs. A highly gifted pyromancer, she is not one for subtlety or grace. Chandra is particularly good with fire and uses it to resolve whatever situation she might be in. She values ingenuity and improvisation with her magic. She is passionate, impulsive, and doesn't much like authority, as typifies characters tightly bound to red mana. Even though Chandra is proud of her independent nature, she also recognizes the volatile nature of her inner fire. She studied under Jaya to learn better control over her pyromancy. She can also conjure some fiery creatures – anything from adorable little embercats to massive flaming elementals and phoenixes.</p>

			<p>Although hotheaded, she cares deeply for those she calls friends and takes one's death as a personal failure on her part.</p>
			
			<p>Chandra is a planeswalker centered in red mana. When creating spells, Chandra's hair becomes flame and at times her eyes glow red. As she planeswalks, she disappears in a conflagration of orange and red flame. The act leaves a scent behind like the last wisps of smoke from a fireplace.</p>

		<h1>Nissa Revane</h1>
	</section>
	<section>
		<div class="pwinf" style="color: white;">
			<p>Nissa has long dark hair, large pointed ears, and Joraga tattoos on her face. She is usually clothed in green leather clothes with a high collar and cloak, knee-high leather boots, and a bright green sash about her waist. She stands 5'5″ tall and weighs 115 lbs. Her eyes are green, including the sclera, iris, and pupil. When creating spells, Nissa's eyes and tattoos shine bright green.</p>

			<p>During her compleation, Nissa had two new arms grafted onto her body. Black tears streak her cheeks. Much of her body was replaced with copper root and bramble. Her voice was left unchanged. After she was brought to Zhalfir and before her uncompleation, Koth, Karn, and the Zhalfirin healers removed as much of the Phyrexian metal from her body as they could.</p>
			
			<p>Nissa was first presented as a proud nature mage who believed that elves are the pinnacle race of the multiverse, and the Joraga the greatest of them all. Born on Zendikar, she possessed a deep love for her home plane, originally to the exclusion of all others. She was said to have a deep-seated hatred of vampires, a fear of snakes, and a love for flowers. Her first incarnation as such was a tribal Elf planeswalker Nissa was retconned into an animist whose ties to her home plane go beyond that of a normal shaman or even a druid. As such, most other planeswalker iterations of Nissa were based on land animation or Elementals. Her soul speaks to Zendikar, and the land is as much a part of her as the blood pumping inside her veins. In this view, she is much more tolerant of other races.</p>
			
			<p>Since leaving the Joraga, music became Nissa's favorite indulgence. Before joining the Gatewatch, she meditated daily.</p>
			
			<p>Nissa's magical abilities are rivaled by her martial strength, she's a seasoned warrior who is as comfortable in a sword duel as stomping through a city riding a massive animated tree. She has archery, swordplay, and scouting skills. Her affinity for Zendikar lends her power there beyond what she's capable of elsewhere in The Multiverse, able to channel the planes' vast reservoirs of magic into incredible feats. She can communicate and connect with the Worldsoul from every plane and manipulate leylines. She has sensitive hearing.</p>
			
			<p>Nissa Revane is primarily Green-aligned but secondary in Black and tertiary in Blue.</p>
